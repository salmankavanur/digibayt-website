- Consider a content delivery network (CDN)

## 3. Clear Call-to-Actions (CTAs)

**Guide your visitors toward conversion.** Effective CTAs tell users exactly what action to take next, whether it's making a purchase, signing up for a newsletter, or requesting a quote.

Your CTAs should be:
- Visually prominent
- Written with action-oriented language
- Strategically placed throughout your site
- A/B tested for optimal performance

## 4. Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

**If they can't find you, they can't buy from you.** Implementing solid SEO practices ensures your website ranks well in search results, driving organic traffic to your business.

Essential SEO elements include:
- Keyword research and implementation
- Meta titles and descriptions
- Alt text for images
- Schema markup
